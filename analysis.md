## Identified Issues

### 1. Mobile Chatbot Issues
- **API Key Error**: The chatbot shows "Failed to get AI response. Please check your API key and network connection" error
- **Mobile Layout**: The chatbot appears to be responsive but needs testing with actual API functionality
- **Conversation Flow**: Need to test if conversations get cut off on mobile devices

### 2. Missing Service Information
- **Rates**: Chatbot doesn't know about the $100/day or $20/hour rates for all services
- **Booking Process**: No information about 50% deposit requirement
- **Contact Method**: Missing information about final arrangements via WhatsApp
- **Client Information**: No mention that real names are not required

### 3. Current Chatbot Prompt

Respond in a friendly, professional manner with a slight Vice City/80s flair. Help users with service information, Costa Rica recommendations, and booking assistance.
